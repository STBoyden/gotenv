# Gotenv?

Gotenv is a very simple Go package to load environment variables from a `.env` format file. Documentation for the package can be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/STBoyden/gotenv).

The library has two main features:

1. Load from a default `.env` file.
2. Load from a specified file in the `.env` format.

To install, simply do the following:

```bash
go get github.com/STBoyden/gotenv@latest
```
